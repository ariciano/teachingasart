My Sophomore Year

Sophomore year of high school, in America, is the 10th grade/second year of high school. During this time, students would be in their final transitions from junior high school/middle school and embarking towards the journey of college. The mindset is still rather young, as recess (the period in between classes when everyone was allowed to go outside to play) was only 4 years ago. This is the time when students are preparing to truly become adults and responsible of themselves - as in America, 18 is the year of adulthood and sophomores are typically 15-16 years old.

My personal experience in high school was an amazing one. I had always greatly enjoyed education and the school atmosphere. My 10th grade year was truly a transformative period for myself. This was around the time that social media outlets were becoming more prevalent amongst the culture and technology was providing different sources of communication. This was also around the time that I began to develop very meaningful relationships among my peers. This was the time that I was truly learning about myself as a person. But, this was also a time where I was being challenge the most, academically, and losing interest in the “educational” part of high school. 

Using the insights that I have gathered through the lens as a sophomore student, the lens as someone who studies pedagogy and education reform, and the lens of someone that has taught classes, I decided to create a curriculum that embodies the skills that I felt that I needed to be the most well rounded person at that appropriate time period. These skills would reflect the technological advances of the time, understanding self and human behavior, the need to express myself creatively, learning how to eat, the necessity of understanding finances, the vital understanding and awareness of Black history and literature and the way in which English works through the study of Latin. These skills would better prepare me as a person and student that would be transitioning to college and adulthood.

More background info: During this time, I had become greatly interested in technology, I had already started my first business (in 9th grade), I left Latin to study Spanish, I was heavily passionate about the arts, my body was growing and changing constantly, I was beginning to learn more about money and I grew up in a Dominican-American household but was not entirely informative of my history.


Teaching Philosophy

The education within every classroom should reflect the culture of the students and the period of life that they are embarking. Education should provide life skills, training in thinking proactively and creatively, be challenging and provide the fundamental seeds to grow of understanding within every subject to then be able to take it further - however desired. Education is not merely about “academics” and learning skills that would create for better test scores, education should also provide the keys to opening doors of philosophy, self improvement and wellness, and understanding of the world around them - beyond the classroom.

In the way teaching is done, just as Professor Taeyoon explained in his second class of Teaching as Art, teachers are part salespeople. I believe that the excitement of course, begins with the way in which a teacher embodies the course within themselves. When I look back at my education experiences, I typically felt more excited about the course when the professor was very passionate about the course, themselves. Thus, I am interested in exploring in making each class it’s own brand. And creating the branding of each class so that students would be able to select from courses as if they were in a grocery store. 



Philosophy of Courses

Within each course, I wanted to create a hybrid of courses and blend in different possible skills that would be obtained upon completion. So, there are no purely “Math” or “History” courses. These courses are being taught, but in more practical and progressive ways.

Students would also embark on different tracks: Art/Design, Science, Language, etc. that they would be able to select every semester. These tracks would determine the nature of their final project for the course:

ART TRACK 

[TECH] Internet Self Portrait: This course is a blend of creative coding, HTML, CSS, and self understanding. Students would create a website the portrays themselves.

[PHILOSOPHY] Philosophy of Entrepreneurship: Becoming aware of philosophy and behavior science is a great skill as one transitions into adulthood and interacts with many different type of people. Being able to use the understanding of how people operate, while creating a self-started business, is even more powerful. Students would use the skills they gathered within their tech and art courses, to further develop the prototype or branding of their prototype.

[ART] Meta Magazine: This is a visual arts course that allows students to create tangible and digital art, then use that same art to create more art - ending with a final product of a magazine. Students would also use the literature they created in their literature courses, to provide text for the magazine.

[SCIENCE] Food for the Soul: This course covers chemistry and health by studying how food interacts with the body. Students would then design a vending machine that would provide access to optimal health.

[MATH] Moneymatician: This course teaches algebra II as students learn about finances and how to best prepare themselves when embarking on loans for college, homes, businesses, etc. Students will end the course with a visual pamphlet that would teach their peers how to best manage their money as they enter adulthood.

[HISTORY/LANGUAGE] AfroKaleidoscope: This course allows for students to learn about the history and literature of the Black culture within the spectrum of different Black societies. Students would then collaborate to create a textbook based off of an album of a select artist.

[LANGUAGE] Latin Tree: This course allows for students to learn Latin that will then help them in understanding the roots of the English course. Students will then write a short play while using only latin.


Learning Objective

The learning objective is to create exciting and interesting atmospheres that cater’s to the students interests, while showing them different styles of application. The academics are not only based on interests of the students, but vital and practical skills that they will need as they progress into adulthood.

Learning Outcome

Students will become well rounded after having gathered an assortment of different skills within a few courses. Students will also build skills in learning how to apply their education to practical and artistic use.

Outcome Objective

The design of this education focuses on efficiency and progressiveness. This education style is meant to give students the fundamental skills to go above and beyond with their education. The “tracks” within the curriculum allows for students to use what they have learned and apply it in a way that they enjoy best, as their final. This creates for a consistently challenging but also exciting and rewarding learning atmosphere. The final projects are also meant to further nurture students true understanding of the course as they require additional learning, beyond what was learned in the classroom, to complete them.
